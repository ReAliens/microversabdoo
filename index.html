          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

      <section id="while" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>While</h1></header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code>while (condition) statement </code>
        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
          group those statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        </p>
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } </code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code
        >
      </section>
      <section id="conditions" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>conditions</h1></header>
        <p>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code> if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } </code>
        <p>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code>
          if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
        </code>
        <p>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:
        </p>
        <code>
          if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
        </code>
        <p>
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        </p>
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } </code>
        <p>
          If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
          practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
          example:
        </p>
        <code> if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ } </code>
